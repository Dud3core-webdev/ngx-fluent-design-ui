# NGXFluentDesign UI
An open-source, Angular implementation of Microsoft's Fluent Design system. Based off designs found in the official [Figma File](https://aka.ms/FluentToolkits/Web/Figma)

## WARNING
We've only tested this package with Angular 11. We are working out a plan to support multiple versions of Angular, but for now use at your own risk!

## Getting started:

`yarn add ngx-fluent-design`\
`npm i ngx-fluent-design`

## Usage
You can view the [docs](https://ngx-fluent-design.mfwebdev.net/home) for this library for more information.

We are working on documentation alongside the actual library, so bare with us if every component isn't documented.

## Requests

This is an open source library so go ahead and open some requests if you need a component. I want to actively work on this.

If you find any issues, then feel free to report them on [Github](https://github.com/Dud3core-webdev/ngx-fluent-design-ui)
