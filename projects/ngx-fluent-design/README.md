# NGXFluentDesign UI

An open-source, Angular implementation of Microsoft's Fluent Design system. Based off designs found in the official [Figma File](https://aka.ms/FluentToolkits/Web/Figma)

## WARNING
We've only tested this package with Angular 11. We are working out a plan to support multiple versions of Angular, but for now use at your own risk!

## UPDATES (V: 0.1.14):
This is an absolute monster patch boi 3000. 
- Added a tonne of new components including progress indicators, spinners. 
- started implementing an Icon library,
- fixed bad CSS, 
- added link buttons, 
- made some adjustments to pre-existing components so that they fall inline with official MS Fluent Design Figma file.
- Working on tooling to make sure we can get changes out as quickly (easily) as possible.
- Unit tested components to make sure everything behaves correctly.

Massive shout out to [Smephey](https://github.com/Smephey) for helping with all this and making everything look great!

We're pretty stoked on this library so far, and there's definitely more updates to come! We're aiming for a V1 release as soon as possible.
