# NGXFluentDesign UI

## WARNING

I've only tested this library on Angular 11, I will be working on compatibility at some point, but for now I'd probably only install it if Ivy is enabled in your project, just to be safe.

## UPDATES (V 0.0.9):
- Added new checkbox component

## Getting started:

`yarn add ngx-fluent-design`\
`npm i ngx-fluent-design`

## Usage
(I will be adding more documentation for this library, I just need to really get my head down and work on it.)

You can view the [docs](https://ngx-fluent-design.mfwebdev.net/home) for this library for more information.

## Components:
So far the library is very limited in components:

- Action Button
- Compound Action Button
- Card
- Document Card (Basic implementation)
- Input 
- Multi-Line Input (TextArea)
- Message bar

## Requests

This is an open source library so go ahead and open some requests if you need a component. I want to actively work on this.

If you find any issues, then feel free to report them on [Github](https://github.com/Dud3core-webdev/ngx-fluent-design-ui)
