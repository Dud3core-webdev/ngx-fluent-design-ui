# NGXFluentDesign UI
An open-source, Angular implementation of Microsoft's Fluent Design system. Based off designs found in the official [Figma File](https://aka.ms/FluentToolkits/Web/Figma)

### Version support: 
- Angular 11
- Angular 12
- Angular 13

We will always support the latest 2 versions with new components and features, we will only be doing bug features for the third-latest version, however.

## Patch Notes: 13.0.7
- Breaking change with styles. We have a Tool on docs that will convert your hex palette to RGB values.

## Getting started:

`yarn add ngx-fluent-design`\
`npm i ngx-fluent-design`

## Usage
You can view the [docs](https://ngx-fluent-design.mfwebdev.net/home) for this library for more information.

We are working on documentation alongside the actual library, so bare with us if every component isn't documented.

## Requests

This is an open source library so go ahead and open some requests if you need a component. I want to actively work on this.

If you find any issues, then feel free to report them on [Github](https://github.com/Dud3core-webdev/ngx-fluent-design-ui)
